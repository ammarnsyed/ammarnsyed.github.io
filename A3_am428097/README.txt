My Portfolio website Assignment 2

Author: Ammar Syed B00875730

Introduction
This project is my portfolio website as a software engineer. It contains various pages such as Home, About, and Contact, each with its own unique content and features.

I have reused my code from Assignment 1 for Assignment 2. I made an external css file where I make all the necessary changes for Assignment 2.

Pages

Home

The Home page provides a brief introduction to the website and all my skills and projects I have worked on throughout my career.
The Hompage also includes an image of me and also has images of social media apps that are linked to mine when clicked on.
The navigation bar uses a nested list which has linked sub sections for the homepage, and  also has the about and contact pages whcih are linked.
The Homepage consists of my Education and is structured in an ordered list to show where I went to for high school and further education. 

About
The About page contains information about me, including my background, skills, and experience. It also inlcudes my hobbies and what I like to do in my free time.
It includes two videos which showcase my hobbies one is an embedded youtube short and the other is a video file.

Contact
The Contact page provides a form for visitors to get in touch with me. It includes fields for the visitor's name, email, and message.
It also includes an audio file that can be controlled such as pausing, playing and increasing or decreasing the volume.

Each Page has my social media linked in the bottom of the page so that people can connect with me and follow me there to be updated with what I am doing.

Part 3 Additional CSS

While doing the code review, I added all the necessary styling and design changes to my website. After coming across Part 3, I realized
that i had to use different selectors when using CSS so instead of refactoring all my css, I just added all the selectors to one block of
code.

I used all the different CSS selectors on the form section, in the Contact Page of my Website. In the CSS file I mark where each selector
is used in the form so that it is easier to find.
